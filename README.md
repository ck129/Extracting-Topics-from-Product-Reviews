# Extracting-Topics-from-Product-Reviews
we will implement topic modelling using Python. 
The dataset considered consists of reviews of fine foods from amazon. The data span
a period of more than 10 years, including all ~500,000 reviews up to October 2012.
Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plain text review. It
also includes reviews from all other Amazon categories.
Two approaches will be used for topic modeling: Latent Dirichlet
Allocation and Non-Negative Matrix factorization.
